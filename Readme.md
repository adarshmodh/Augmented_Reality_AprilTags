In this assignment, you are given a set of images with an AprilTag. You are also given the size of
the tag and the pixel locations of its corners on the images. Your task is to recover the camera pose
with two different approaches: PnP with coplanar assumption, and P3P followed by Procrustes.
After you recover the camera pose, we will place a virtual camera at that same position to render
a virtual bird as if it stands on the tag.
